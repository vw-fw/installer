# Veritawall installer

A scriptable replacement for bsdinstaller based on bsdinstall using
cpdup utility to be able to clone a live system.

The repository holds our script adjustments which are workflow and
branding related, but plug seamlessly into the base directory.

The "opnsense-installer" script will still offer a launchpad for
the internals from the core package side.
